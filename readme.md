## Reflection (Required for Marking)

I developed a Micro CRM Leads web application using Node.js, Express, and JavaScript based on the Project 1 instructions. The app allows users to create, view, and edit leads, with all data stored locally in a JSON file through a RESTful API. This project helped me strengthen my full-stack development skills, including building and testing server routes, handling API requests, and connecting the frontend to a backend service using fetch() for dynamic data interaction.

I also enhanced my DevOps skills by cloning my GitHub repository using terminal commands and deploying the web service live using Render. In addition, I practiced DevSecOps principles by creating a .gitignore file to protect sensitive application files and data from being exposed in the repository.

The layout of the application is minimal and easy to use, but for a better user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), I would improve the design by adding a color theme, and enhance the layout structure and interactivity. This could be done by adding success and error messages (e.g., "Lead added successfully"), and integrating a framework like Ionic or Bootstrap to make the user interface more responsive and visually appealing.
